# EXORsim - Motorola EXORciser Simulator

## Introduction

EXORsim is a Linux/Cygwin program that simulates a Motorola EXORciser, which was
a development system that [Motorola](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola)
introduced in 1975 based on their 8-bit
[6800](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6800) and
[6809](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6809) microprocessors.  They
are analogous to Intel's [Intellec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellec)
development system for their own microprocessors.

Some more pictures of this development system can be found at Pekka Tanskanen's website [here](http://www.exorciser.net/index_en.htm).

The EXORciser was influential in the M6800 world:

* The [Fairlight CMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairlight_CMI) sampling synthesize was developed on it
  * See especially [Tony Furse's Qasar M8](https://www.outofphase.fr/en/qasar-en/)
* The [First Digital Camera](https://thephotographeronline.com/current-issue/meet-the-inventor-of-the-first-digital-camera) was developed on it
* The EXORciser was used by [Williams Electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMS_Industries) to develop software for pinball machines in the 1980s, as well as the Defender video game. Here's [Steve Ritchie and Larry DeMar working on Black Knight](doc/williams.jpg)

Documentation for the EXORciser can be found here:

Disk images for the EXORciser can be found here:

[http://www.bitsavers.org/bits/Motorola/Exorcisor/](http://www.bitsavers.org/bits/Motorola/Exorcisor/)

You need to use [ImageDisk](http://www.classiccmp.org/dunfield/img/index.htm) to extract the binary data from from the .IMD
files (requires MS-DOS).

	imdu disk.imd disk.dsk /b

Or you can use "imdx" provided in this repository:

	./imdx disk.imd

The EXORciser was designed primarily to help you write assembly language
programs for Motorola's 8-bit microprocessors, including 6800, 6801, 6805 and
6809.  But it also supported some high level language compilers including
BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL, [MPL](https://github.com/jhallen/exorsim/blob/master/mpl/readme.md) and PASCAL.

The EXORciser could be used without any disk drives.  In this case, you
would use either a paper tape punch and reader, usually as part of an [ASR33
Teletype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33), or cassette tape
storage, for example as included with a [TI ASR 733](https://terminals-wiki.org/wiki/index.php/TI_Silent_700_Model_733). 
But it was much more pleasant if you did have floppy drives, such as the
EXORdisk-I,-II, or -III.  In this case, there were a number of available operating systems:

* EDOS-I  (primitive OS with no file names- files are refered to by number, for EXORdisk-I)
* EDOS-II   (primitive OS with 5 character file names, for EXORdisk-I)
* MDOS   (CP/M-like OS with 8 character file names with two character extensions, for EXORdisk-II/-III)
* MDOS09  (same as MDOS, but for 6809-based EXORcisers)

There was an all-in-one follow-on system called [EXORset](https://www.retrotechnology.com/restore/exorset.html)
available in the early 1980s.  This system had a built-in terminal, used 5 1/4" mini-floppies and 
ran "XDOS".  XDOS is nearly identical to the 6809 version of MDOS, but with mini-floppy
support.

**New!** EXORsim can now simulate a 6809-based EXORciser as well as the
original 6800-based one.  It can run both MDOS and MDOS09.

## SWTPC

EXORsim also simulates a [SWTPC 6800 Computer System](https://deramp.com/swtpc.html), which allows you to run
the [TSC FLEX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLEX_%28operating_system%29) operating system.

## EXORsim

EXORsim is a terminal program- it's invoked at the UNIX shell and runs in
the user's ANSI terminal emulator (such as XTerm).  This allows you to use
terminal emulator features such as scroll-back.  I find this to be more
useful than some emulators which run under MS-Windows, but provide only a
very rudimentary terimnal.

EXORsim Simulates 6800 CPU and the following peripherals:

* MC6850 "ACIA"-based serial port (UART)
  * EXORsim emulates an EXORterm 155 by converting its control sequences into ANSI ones
    * This allows the [EDITORM Resident Editor](https://github.com/jhallen/exorsim/blob/master/doc/mdos-intro.md#e-editorm-resident-editor) to operate in screen mode.
* Line printer port
  * Output is appended to a file "listing.lp"
  * "listing.lp" can be converted to a .pdf file using the included "lpf" program
* Floppy disk controller
  * EXORdisk-II floppy diskette controller emulated by intercepting calls to the controller ROM
  * SWTPC [MF68](https://deramp.com/swtpc.com/MF_68/MF_68_Index.htm) with DC_1 emulated by hardware emulation of the [FD1771](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Digital_FD1771) controller.

<h3>Example session</h3>

Right now the exbug.bin (or swtbug.bin for SWTPC) files must be in the
current directory.

'=' is the MDOS command prompt.

You can also emulate a 6809-based EXORciser:

Hit Ctrl-C once to access the simulator's debugger prompt.

Hit Ctrl-C again to exit EXORsim, or use the 'c' command to continue
simulating.

See the [MDOS quick start](doc/mdos-intro.md) to see how to use MDOS editors
and write simple assembly langauge programs.

Also see [EXORsim usage guide](doc/usage.md) for more usage information.

## SWTPC FLEX

To simulate SWTPC instead, run with the --swtpc option:

'swtbug.bin' loaded.
'flex.dsk' opened for drive 0 (tracks=80 sectors=72)

# Build instructions

1. Make a clone of this repository

2. (Linux)

	sudo make install

2. (Cygwin) "run as administrator" the Cygwin terminal, then:

	make install

This will install the binaries in /usr/local/bin and install the data files
in /usr/local/share/exorsim.  When you run exor or exor09, the default drive 0
disk image is copied to $HOME/.exorsim.

The search order for data files is:

1. Current directory
2. $HOME/.exorsim
3. /usr/local/share/exorsim

# Utilities

A number of utilities are built in addition to "exor":

	mdos	This provides file access to MDOS diskette images

	edos	This provides read-only file access to EDOS-II diskette images

	unasm	This is a stand-alone 6800 disassember

	imdx	Utility to extract disk images from .imd files
		(so that you don't have to run MS-DOS)

	lpf	Convert ASCII line printer output (66 lines per page) to
		PostScript.  Then use ps2pdf to generate a .PDF file.

# Blank disks

	sblank.dsk	Single sided blank disk with filesystem installed (DOSGEN ;U)

	dblank.dsk	Double sided blank disk with filesystem installed (DOSGEN ;U)
