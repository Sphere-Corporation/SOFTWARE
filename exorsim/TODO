Exor:
  write man page

  maybe replace --exbug with something implying that it's the entire memory image

  assembler:
    non-motorola mode? (; comments, : after label, allow whitespace ?)
    Include 6809 assembler improvements for 6800?
    expression evaluator including Motorola operators

  exorterm update(): maybe call it periodically even if there is no input polling

  Generic simulator setup? Something like:
     device acia 0xfcf4 0xfcf5
     ram 0x0000 0xe7ff
     readonly 0xf000 0xfbff
     readonly 0xe800 0xebff
     cpu 6809
     load 0xf000 exor.bin
     load 0xe800 fdc.bin
     setword 0xFFFe 0xF000

  Step over function (we only have step into now)
  Break key
  More breakpoints

  Ctrl-C twice sends Ctrl-C to program?  It exists now.. or some way to send Ctrl-C to program.

  6800 simulator: add 6801, 6811, 6816 support
  6809 simulator: add 6309 support
  6809 version of flex, should be possible.  There is already a flex09 emulator.

  Share symbols from external assembler for facts
  Some way to read assembly listing for symbols (improved facts file).

  Show top of stack command?

  User GNU readline or add history for monitor jgetline?  We probably also want tab-completion

  Televideo emulation for Flex2?  Maybe not necessary.

  Direct support of .imd files so that binary extract
  is not necessary?

Mdos:

  Support writing binary files
  Add rename function
  Add format function to create a blank disk.
  Check for read/write errors to disk.
  Check disk size for reads/writes.
  Check MDOS file name is 8.2

  Add support for EXORset mini-floppies

  Direct support of .imd files?

Unasm:

  Tracing to discover all valid code...

HTDOCs:

  Finish MDOS tech page.
  Add inline links to MDOS info.  Add links to MDOS info source.
  Mention Windows exor emulator.
  Add installation information

  Document what emulator actually emulates (hardware addresses, subroutine
  calls..)

  Document monitor ROMs.


- - -
Done:
  Create Linux version of ImageDisk imdu command.

  Exorterm emulation (if we can find docs for it..)

  MDOS extract all files

  Detect intercepted jumps for exbug-1.1 and exbug-1.2 by looking at code, otherwise fall back
  to ACIA polling.

  Backport instruction set fixes to 6800
     DAA
     NEG

  u with no args should continue unassembling from last address

  better 'm' command

  l command:
    Return to prompt when S9 received [fixed]
    Read S19 from file if filename given (we have this with input redirection)

  l command: file name argument instead of input redirect which is weird

  regs command must show 6809 regs

  Re-enable exorterm mode: I think it just needed flushes or update calls.

  6809 version of disassembler

  6809 version of assembler
    setdp directive
    parse_word should handle motorola identifiers
    complain if there is extra junk (space begins comment after operand)
    < and > to force index size and direct/extended

  Merge exor / exor09

  Default options and file locations in environment variables, so you don't need
  exbug.bin in current directory.
     [now we have environment variables for this]

  Switch disks
     [drive0..drive3 commands]

  "make install" (needs paths to binaries).
