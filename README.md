## SOFTWARE LIBRARY

This repo is a software library of useful items of software that I have found on the internet, or people have directed me towards.

Some of these are tools or software not directly related to the Sphere-1, but are, nonetheless, useful, others are programs directly related to the Sphere-1 which I have used to advance my knowledge and skills in related areas, such as 6800 Assembly language and how the Sphere-1 functions etc.

I do not own ANY of the copyright for these items, nor would I wish to claim any attribution for them, they are simply collected here for convenience.

Licenses for the software contained herein are the responsibility of the creator of that software.

Any modifications that I have done to any code are done in good faith.

### Note:
Whilst I do not wish to repeat a "collection" of Sphere-1 resources (for that, you should seek [Sphere Resources](https://sphere.computer/resources.html) by Ben Zotto, I did want to collect some useful stuff to me together as a convenience.
